# Huffman
**NOTICE: This implementation of Huffman works and fully utilizes parallel CPU's. This package was, however, not built with
extreme optimization in mind and is not meant to be used in production environments, but was designed as more of an educational help.**

Repository with implementation for Huffman encoding and decoding, optimized for multicore CPU's.
